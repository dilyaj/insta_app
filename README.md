Backend API created through Ruby on Rails.
We used 2 models, quote and user.
The model relationship is that a quote belongs to user and users have many quotes.

# Strengths - 
The main feature of this app is that you can find quotes that are relelvant to your "Mood" search. We did this by using Active Record Query Interface. RoR has this cool method called ".where" that filters the current relation according to the conditions in the arguments. I did something similar to this in my last project and this was a lot cleaner than JS. e really enjoyed this.
